# Job Tracker Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to address several issues with the Job Tracker application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Timestamp Issues
**Problem**: Wrong timing being displayed for job postings and logs. This was due to using naive datetime objects without timezone information.
**Solution**: 
- Updated all datetime columns in database models to use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` instead of `datetime.utcnow()`
- This ensures all datetimes are stored with proper timezone information
- Fixed timezone conversion in log display for better readability

### 2. Log Display Issues
**Problem**: Logs not showing detailed scraper output and important information.
**Solution**:
- Enhanced log viewer to prioritize and highlight scraper summary information
- Improved timestamp handling with proper timezone conversion
- Added special formatting for important log entries like scraper summaries
- Made sure logs maintain chronological order for better readability

### 3. Storage Issues
**Problem**: Storage doubling when changes are committed, leading to excessive disk usage.
**Solution**: 
- Created `cleanup_storage.py` script to clean up redundant files
- Added functionality to optimize Git repository with `git gc`
- Implemented cleanup of `__pycache__` directories and old log files
- Added large log file truncation to prevent excessive log growth

### 4. Custom Job Roles
**Problem**: Manually added job roles not appearing or being recognized properly.
**Solution**:
- Enhanced the role validation system to dynamically accept new roles
- Added more predefined roles to the `VALID_ROLES` list
- Modified `clean_role_name()` function to accept and add valid custom roles
- Improved logging to track when new roles are added

### 5. Deployment Fixes
**Problem**: Issues with automatic deployment and service management.
**Solution**:
- Created `apply_fixes.py` script to apply all fixes in one go
- Added functionality to update database schema with Alembic migrations
- Included service restart functionality for smooth deployment
- Made scripts more robust with better error handling

## Application Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Timestamp Handling
- All datetime fields now use timezone-aware datetime objects
- Consistent handling of UTC timestamps throughout the application
- Local timezone conversion for display purposes only

### 2. Improved Log Management
- Better organization of log content
- Highlighting of important information like scraper summaries
- Automatic log rotation and cleanup to prevent excessive growth
- Enhanced readability with formatting and timezone adjustments

### 3. Storage Optimization
- Automated cleanup of redundant files
- Git repository optimization to reduce storage requirements
- Prevention of duplicate files in backups
- Cleanup of temporary Python cache files

### 4. Better Role Handling
- Dynamic acceptance of valid role names
- More comprehensive validation of role names
- Improved mapping of similar role names
- Expanded list of predefined valid roles

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. Run the provided `apply_fixes.py` script to apply all fixes at once:
   ```
   python apply_fixes.py --all
   ```

2. For specific fixes only, use the appropriate flags:
   ```
   python apply_fixes.py --storage   # Clean up storage only
   python apply_fixes.py --database  # Update database schema only
   python apply_fixes.py --restart   # Restart services only
   ```

3. The script will log all actions to `fixes.log` for tracking.

## Verification

After applying the fixes, you should notice:

1. Correct timestamps in the UI and logs
2. More detailed scraper logs with proper formatting
3. Reduced disk usage and better storage management
4. Custom job roles appearing correctly
5. Better overall performance and stability

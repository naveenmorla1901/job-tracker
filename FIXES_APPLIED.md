# Job Tracker Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to address several issues with the Job Tracker application.

## Latest Fixes (April 2025)

### 1. Backend Scheduler and Port Conflicts
**Problem**: Backend logs continuously generating due to port conflicts, scheduler issues, and multiple instances of the API server trying to start simultaneously.
**Solution**:
- Created `free_port.py` script to detect and kill processes using required ports
- Updated scheduler job IDs to be consistent and prevent duplication
- Added port conflict checking before API startup
- Modified service files to automatically clear port conflicts before starting

### 2. Empty Label Warnings in Streamlit
**Problem**: Dashboard logs showing warnings about empty labels in Streamlit components.
**Solution**:
- Fixed checkboxes to use proper labels with hidden visibility rather than empty labels
- Updated custom UI components to comply with accessibility recommendations

### 3. System Logs Display
**Problem**: Not all system logs being displayed in the web interface.
**Solution**:
- Enhanced log display to show logs from multiple sources
- Added tabs for Nginx and PostgreSQL logs
- Implemented multi-file log reading for more comprehensive logging
- Added safety checks to prevent errors when logs are not accessible

### 4. Multiple Service Instances
**Problem**: Multiple instances of PostgreSQL, Nginx, and application servers running simultaneously.
**Solution**:
- Created `restart_services.py` to properly manage service lifecycles
- Added `clean_start.py` script for complete system cleanup and restart
- Implemented process checks to prevent duplicate instances
- Added systemd service improvements to better handle restarts

### 5. Scheduler Runs
**Problem**: Scheduler not running correctly from 7AM to 5PM as intended.
**Solution**:
- Fixed scheduler configuration with proper job IDs
- Added checks to prevent duplicate scheduler instances
- Improved logging for scheduler operations
- Implemented startup detection to prevent unnecessary job runs

### 6. Improved Role Validation
**Problem**: Scrapers retrieving irrelevant job roles (e.g., "O9 Technical Architect") that don't match input roles.
**Solution**:
- Created `role_utils.py` utility module for role validation
- Implemented intelligent role matching and filtering
- Added automatic filtering to all scrapers using a decorator
- Provided testing tool for verifying role validation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Timestamp Issues
**Problem**: Wrong timing being displayed for job postings and logs. This was due to using naive datetime objects without timezone information.
**Solution**: 
- Updated all datetime columns in database models to use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` instead of `datetime.utcnow()`
- This ensures all datetimes are stored with proper timezone information
- Fixed timezone conversion in log display for better readability

### 2. Log Display Issues
**Problem**: Logs not showing detailed scraper output and important information.
**Solution**:
- Enhanced log viewer to prioritize and highlight scraper summary information
- Improved timestamp handling with proper timezone conversion
- Added special formatting for important log entries like scraper summaries
- Made sure logs maintain chronological order for better readability

### 3. Storage Issues
**Problem**: Storage doubling when changes are committed, leading to excessive disk usage.
**Solution**: 
- Created `cleanup_storage.py` script to clean up redundant files
- Added functionality to optimize Git repository with `git gc`
- Implemented cleanup of `__pycache__` directories and old log files
- Added large log file truncation to prevent excessive log growth

### 4. Custom Job Roles
**Problem**: Manually added job roles not appearing or being recognized properly.
**Solution**:
- Enhanced the role validation system to dynamically accept new roles
- Added more predefined roles to the `VALID_ROLES` list
- Modified `clean_role_name()` function to accept and add valid custom roles
- Improved logging to track when new roles are added

### 5. Deployment Fixes
**Problem**: Issues with automatic deployment and service management.
**Solution**:
- Created `apply_fixes.py` script to apply all fixes in one go
- Added functionality to update database schema with Alembic migrations
- Included service restart functionality for smooth deployment
- Made scripts more robust with better error handling

## Application Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Timestamp Handling
- All datetime fields now use timezone-aware datetime objects
- Consistent handling of UTC timestamps throughout the application
- Local timezone conversion for display purposes only

### 2. Improved Log Management
- Better organization of log content
- Highlighting of important information like scraper summaries
- Automatic log rotation and cleanup to prevent excessive growth
- Enhanced readability with formatting and timezone adjustments

### 3. Storage Optimization
- Automated cleanup of redundant files
- Git repository optimization to reduce storage requirements
- Prevention of duplicate files in backups
- Cleanup of temporary Python cache files

### 4. Better Role Handling
- Dynamic acceptance of valid role names
- More comprehensive validation of role names
- Improved mapping of similar role names
- Expanded list of predefined valid roles

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. Run the provided `apply_fixes.py` script to apply all fixes at once:
   ```
   python apply_fixes.py --all
   ```

2. For specific fixes only, use the appropriate flags:
   ```
   python apply_fixes.py --storage   # Clean up storage only
   python apply_fixes.py --database  # Update database schema only
   python apply_fixes.py --restart   # Restart services only
   ```

3. The script will log all actions to `fixes.log` for tracking.

## Verification

After applying the fixes, you should notice:

1. Correct timestamps in the UI and logs
2. More detailed scraper logs with proper formatting
3. Reduced disk usage and better storage management
4. Custom job roles appearing correctly
5. Better overall performance and stability

If any issues persist, please check the application logs and the `fixes.log` file for more information.
